-- OUTER JOINS ----------------------------------------------------------------- 
-- 1.  Retrieve the locations to show the number of course sections scheduled to 
--     run in each of those locations. Sort the result by location ID. Include 
--     also locations that do not have a course section scheduled in them yet.  



-- 2.  Write an INSERT statement (as shown in class; you may also get help from 
--     the script file that populated the tables1) to add a course section that 
--     has not been scheduled in a location yet. i.e, with loc_id is null. 

--     You can delete the row by the DELETE2 statement.  

--     Now, retrieve the faculty's last name, bldg code, room, and the course 
--     section ID of all course sections the faculty member is assigned to teach. 
--     Include all course sections regardless of whether or not they have been 
--     scheduled in a location yet.  
 
--     The result should basically include the row you added above. 



-- 3.  Write another insert statement to add a course section that does not have
--     a faculty member assigned to it yet, i.e., with f_id is null.  

--     Now, retrieve the faculty's last name, bldg code, room, and the course 
--     section ID of all course sections, regardless of whether or not they have 
--     been assigned a faculty member yet OR whether or not they have been 
--     scheduled in a location yet.  



-- 4.  Retrieve the course sections and display the number of students enrolled 
--     in each of them. Include also those course sections that do not have 
--     students enrolled in them. 



-- 5.  Retrieve the term description along with the number of course sections 
--     scheduled for that term.  

--      a. Modify the query to include also those terms that do not have a 
--         course section scheduled in them. 



-- 6.  Rewrite the above query in another way (Note: this is not necessarily a 
--     different way!).  



-- 7.  Retrieve the term ID, term description, and the total maximum enrollment 
--     of all course sections scheduled in that term.



-- 8.  Modify the above query to include also those terms that do not have any 
--     course sections scheduled in it. Show the total as null for those terms 
--     that do not have course sections scheduled in them.  
 



/*
1– to insert a record with c_sec_id 14 
INSERT INTO course_section VALUES (14, 1, 4, 1, NULL, 'MWF', '0000-00-00', '1800', NULL, 140); 


2 – to delete a record from course_section with c_sec_id 14 
DELETE FROM course_section  
WHERE c_sec_id = 14; 
*/



-- SUB-QUERIES -----------------------------------------------------------------
-- Write the following queries using a subquery. When the question says, write 
-- it a different way, you may write it as a join.

-- 1.  Retrieve the last name of all faculty members who teach during the 
--     “Summer 2007” term.  



-- 2.  Retrieve the course section’s day and location of the course 
--     ‘Database Management’ during ‘open’ terms.



-- 3.  Retrieve those faculty IDs who have the same name (first, last) as a 
--     student.



-- 4.  Retrieve the course section ID and the value of the max_enrl column for 
--     all sections that correspond to the highest value for max_enrl. 



-- 5.  Retrieve the course section ID and the value of the max_enrl column for 
--     all sections that do NOT correspond with the course section that has the 
--     highest value for max_enrl. 



-- 6.  Modify the above query to show those course sections below the average 
--     value for max_enrl.  



-- 7.  An interesting one ☺ Retrieve the grade and term ID values for the 
--     student Sarah Miller’s System Analysis course. 



-- 8.  Retrieve the course name and the course ID of all courses that are 
--     prerequisites for other courses.  



-- 9.  Retrieve the term description of those terms that do not have a course 
--     section scheduled in them.  



-- 10.  Another interesting one ☺ write the above query a different way! 



-- UNION ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 
-- 11.  Retrieve the last and first names of all students and faculty. Add a 
--      comment to indicate which entity they belong to. If faculty, say 
--      “FACULTY”, if student, say “STUDENT”. Order the results by last name
